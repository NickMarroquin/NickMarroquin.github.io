## My favorite CPSC 120L Lab Projects


**Lab-01**

> My favorite lab has to be the first one. I was introduced to the Linux operating system and learned how to use the terminal.
I thought it was really interesting how you could do so much by typing commands into a window, like pushing your code to GitHub.
Having a lab partner made learning feel a lot less intimidating sharing our inexperience. I learned how to move through folders,
push files to Github, and edit a basic C++ "Hello World" program. Overall, this was a simple introduction to everything, even
though it was just changing it to say "Hello (your name)."


**Lab-03**

> Lab 3 part 1 was another favorite of mine. Being in a group and working together on the lab was very interesting because we all
had different ideas on how to approach it. I liked learning as a team and writing C++ functions. I learned how to compile and
clean up our code using a linter. It taught me how important it is to fix small formatting mistakes early on, because it's a lot
more work later on


**Lab-06**

> Lab 6, parts 1 and 2, were some of my favorite labs because it felt like our code could be used for something useful. I liked
how we made a program relating to blackjack. I learned how to use vectors, functions, and how to check if a user inputs something
wrong in. This lab helped me understand C++ better.
